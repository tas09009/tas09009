## Hi there, I'm Taniya ðŸ‘‹

I'm looking to become a back end Software Developer after spending the last few years working in Power Engineering. Over the past few months, I've learned Python, Data Structures, volunteered at an open-source learning platform and most recently, completed a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on (next steps for the project):
- [RC Niceties](https://github.com/mjec/rc-niceties): migrate old data from production database to an updated database with a new schema.
- [Wrec API](https://github.com/tas09009/Wrec-API): Add token-based authentication. Create a controllers directory to clean out business logic from views.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: 
- Flask ([Flask Web Development](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/flask-web-development/9781491991725/))
- SQLAlchemy
- Alembic
- Systems Design Fundamentals ([Algo Expert](https://www.algoexpert.io/systems/fundamentals))
- Database designs ([DDIA](https://dataintensive.net/))
