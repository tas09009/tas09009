## Hi there, I'm Taniya ðŸ‘‹

I'm open to working in a python backend position. I originally started working in Power Engineering and have recently transitioned to software over the past 2 years. I've learned Python, Data Structures, dabbled in Data Science, volunteered at an open-source learning platform, completed a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) and most recently worked at [Pinwheel](https://www.pinwheelapi.com/).

ðŸ”­ Personal Projects that Iâ€™m currently working on:
- [RC Niceties](https://github.com/mjec/rc-niceties): migrate old data from production database to an updated database with a new schema. See [PR #82](https://github.com/mjec/rc-niceties/pull/82)
- [Wrec API](https://github.com/tas09009/Wrec-API): Add token-based authentication. Create a controllers directory to clean out business logic from views.

I occassionaly blog at [taniyasingh.com](http://taniyasingh.com/) and you can also reach out at taniya.singh12@gmail.com.
