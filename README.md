## Hi there, I'm Taniya ðŸ‘‹

I most recently worked at [Pinwheel](https://www.pinwheelapi.com/) as an Integrations Engineer, where I worked with fetching data using web scraping and third-party APIs. 

I originally started working in Power Engineering and have recently transitioned to software over the past 2 years. I've learned Python, Data Structures, dabbled in Data Science, volunteered at an open-source learning platform, and attended a coding retreat at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

ðŸ”­ Personal Projects that Iâ€™m currently working on:
- [Wrec API](https://github.com/tas09009/Wrec-API): A visual representation of book genres, organized using the Dewey decimal system.
- [RC Niceties](https://github.com/mjec/rc-niceties): migrate old data from the current database to an updated database with a new schema. See [PR #82](https://github.com/mjec/rc-niceties/pull/82)
- [Foreclosures in CT](https://github.com/tas09009/Pending-Foreclosures-By-Sale): See a list of all upcoming house auctions in CT.


I occasionally blog at [taniyasingh.com](http://taniyasingh.com/) and you can also reach out at taniya.singh12@gmail.com.
